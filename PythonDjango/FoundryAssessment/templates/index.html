            <ul>
                <li>Clone or fork the repo: <i class="bi bi-github"></i><a
                        href="https://github.com/trappett/foundry-assessment"> Github Repo </a> </li>
                <li>The repo contains an existing backend for your app to connect to.</li>
                <li>If you are using Vue, there is an existing skeleton frontend you can use. If you are using React, you will
                    need to create this yourself.</li>
                <li>There are readme.md files in the frontend and backend dirs with details on how to get started. </li>
                <li>Note: backend/data.db contains the database. If at any point you want to wipe your data and start over,
                    delete that file and restart the server. </li>
                <li>Creating components from scratch rather than utilizing an existing component library would be preferred, as
                    it is a better showcase of your ability. In particular, please don't utilize a pre-made datatable component,
                    rather use a table component and implement the necessary logic yourself. </li>
